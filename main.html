            <p class="introduction">
              My name is Teboho Motsoeneng, an aspiring Business Analyst (BA). I'm a final
              year student studying BSc in Information Technology and I'm very much detail
              oriented with the capability of delevering a high level accuracy of projects,
              as I was able to design and code this online technical CV of mine.
            </p>
            <p class="introduction">
              I'm currently based in Johannesburg south, a small township called "Lakeside"
              and I'm into technology, gadgets, and sports. In my free time, I like drawing
              artboards using Adobe Illustrator and portraits too!!! When I am drawing portraits
              I feel like I'm so much artistic and it gives me a sense of art too.
            </p>
            <p class="introduction">
              I designed and developed this website using html5 (for frontend), css3 (for styling my website)
              and javascript (to handle the behaviour of my website). Please click <a class="download" href="files/UpdatedCV.pdf" download="Motsoeneng_T.G_CV">"here"</a>
              to download my CV in a PDF format, thank you! </p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p class="introduction">
              I started my early school days in Nomini Primary School, and then after completing
              my primary I went to Raphela Secondary School, which is where I completed my matric
              at. In my high school I learnt a lot and actually that's where I grew the real love
              for technology which then leaded me into studying Information Technology.
            </p>
            <p class="introduction">
              I'm currently studying in North-West University (Vaal triangle campus) and I have
              learned a lot since from my first year. I'm very much familiar with various programming
              languages such as python, C++, C# and Java. However, I between the laguages I love C#
              more, because C# is a multi-paradigm programming language.

                  <h3>Adobe illustrator</h3>
                </div>
                <p>I love Adobe Illustrator, because it is a  proficient vector-based
                  design and drawing program. I love drawing portraits and artboards
                  with it. I consider myself artistic and I believe that art is good
                  for everyone. Illustrator makes me very creative, which
                  is one of the reasons why I love it so much.</p>
              </div>

                  </div>
                  <h3>Photoshop</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Photoshop is a graphics editor, quite similar to illustrator
                  and it also brings the level of creativity in me. I love working
                  with graphics and creating something meaningful and appealing,
                  because what would the world be like without graphics though? </p>

                  <h3>C# programming</h3>
                </div>
                <p>C# is basically the first programming language I fell in love with.
                   I really enjoyed creating my school projects with it, hence I'm
                   aspiring to become a C# developer specifically with asp.net core
                   framework. I found it fascinating but yet enjoyable.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="skill">

                  </div>
                  <h3>html</h3>
                </div>
                <p>My favorite object-oriented language, C#, has ASP.NET which inrtoduced
                a set of classes of HTML content builder, HTML string, and so on. HTML
                content builder helped me to work with HTML structure when I was developing
                my project called <a class="imageAlbum" href="http://imagealbum.somee.com/">Image album</a>
                .</p>

                  </div>
                  <h3>CSS</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Another thing I like about C# is that it has it's roots in the C family
                  and CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets. Css helped
                  me with styling the front-end of my web applications, which is this one (Online Technical CV)
                  and application I mentioned in HTML skill.</p>

                  </div>
                  <h3>Javascript</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Javascript I use it for the behavior of my web applications. I used it mainly
                  when dealing with validations, and it also helped me with developing applications
                  that interact with application users. Although, I believe that I'm actually a
                  beginner in Javascript as I'm still learning it even now.</p>
