      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Teboho Motsoeneng, an aspiring Business Analyst (BA). I'm a final <br>
        year student studying BSc in Information Technology and I'm very much detail <br>
        oriented with the capability of delevering a high level accuracy of projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently based in Johannesburg south, a small township called "Lakeside" <br>
        and I'm into technology, gadgets, and sports. In my free time, I like drawing <br>
        artboards using Adobe Illustrator and portraits too!!! When I am drawing portraits <br>
        I feel like I'm so much artistic and it gives me a sense of art too.

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I started my early school days in Nomini Primary School, and then after completing <br>
        my primary I went to Raphela Secondary School, which is where I completed my matric <br>
        at. In my high school I learnt a lot and actually that's where I grew the real love <br>
        for technology which then leaded me into studying Information Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently studying in North-West University (Vaal triangle campus) and I have <br>
        learned a lot since from my first year. I'm very much familiar with various programming <br>
        languages such as python, C++, C# and Java. However, I between the laguages I love C# <br>
        more, because C# is a multi-paradigm programming language.

            <h3>Adobe illustrator</h3>
          </div>
          <p>I love Adobe Illustrator, because it is a  proficient vector-based
            design and drawing program. I love drawing portraits and artboards
            with it. I consider myself artistic and I believe that art is good
            for everyone. Illustrator makes me very creative, which
            is one of the reasons why I love it so much.</p>

            <h3>Photoshop</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Photoshop is a graphics editor, quite similar to illustrator
            and it also brings the level of creativity in me. I love working
            with graphics and creating something meaningful and appealing,
            because what would the world be like without graphics though? </p>

            <h3>C# programming</h3>
          </div>
          <p>C# is basically the first programming language I fell in love with.
             I really enjoyed creating my school projects with it, hence I'm
             aspiring to become a C# developer specifically with asp.net core
             framework. I found it fascinating but yet enjoyable.</p>
