    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Teboho Motsoeneng, an aspiring Business Analyst (BA). I'm a final <br>
      year student studying BSc in Information Technology and I'm very much detail <br>
      oriented with the capability of delevering a high level accuracy of projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently based in Johannesburg south, a small township called "Lakeside" <br>
      and I'm into technology, gadgets, and sports. In my free time, I like drawing <br>
      artboards using Adobe Illustrator and portraits too!!! When I am drawing portraits <br>
      I feel like I'm so much artistic and it gives me a sense of art too.
